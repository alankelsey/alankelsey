      <h2>Flower of the Week</h2>
      <img src="content.jpg" alt="White Iris" width="300" height="225" /> 
      <p>This week's featured flower is the white iris. This flower is white. It's an iris. You can trust me to tell the truth about that.</p>
      <p>It grows in the ground. It blooms in the spring. It's known as a spring bulb. It grows from a bulb and the bulbs multiply and if you aren't careful you'll have a whole field full of iris after a few years, because these bulbs are busy being prolific down there in the dark.</p>
      <p>Don't forget to cut some and take them inside because they smell really nice and they don't make you sneeze all that much.</p>
