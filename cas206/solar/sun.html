Among stars, it's an average size, an average temperature. Looking at the galaxy that contains it and more than one hundred billion other stars, you'd never take notice of our sun, revolving around the center of the Milky Way, about halfway out on the inside edge of one of the galaxy's spiral arms.

In our planet's sky, of course, there's no missing it. The sun is the largest object in the solar system, and all life on Earth depends upon its nurturing energy. 

When look at the sun (through safety filters, of course), we see its photosphere, the outer, visible layer that has a temperature of 11,000&deg;F (6,100&deg;C). Sometimes sunspots potmark the surface; sometimes there are none. These areas look darker because they are cooler than the surrounding gases; although they still sizzle at temperatures that range from 6,700&deg;-9,400&deg;F (3,700&deg;-5,200&deg;C). 

Hot as the solar surface is, it's an oasis compared to the superheated goings-on at its heart. Deep inside the sun's core, the high rate of energy generation and the intense pressure—some 333,000 times (that of) Earth&ndash;heats the gas to 27 million&deg;F (15 million&deg;C). The process that fuels the sun is the ceaseless fusion of hydrogen into helium. This, in turn releases energy in the form of gamma rays that bounce from one atom to another until, after a million years or so, the energy finally reaches the sun's surface in the form of visible light and heat. Every second, the sun releases as much energy as 90 billion 1&ndash;megaton hydrogen bombs.

Our average star is about 40 percent along in its expected 12 billion-year lifespan. About six billion years from now, it will have used up its hydrogen fuel and begin fusing its helium nuclei. The sun will swell into a red giant, so huge that it may encompass the Earth's orbit. After another billion years the red giant will eject its outer layers, leaving only a small white dwarf star that will cool and fade away.
