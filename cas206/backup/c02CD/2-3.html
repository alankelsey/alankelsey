<h1>Liquid Layouts </h1>
<h2>From Professional CSS Cascading Style Sheets for Web Design, pages 23-25 </h2>

<p>Proponents of liquid (or "fluid") layouts are quick to counter that fixed-width designs set an unfair technical assumption on our audience: there is no guarantee that our user's browser window is large enough to accommodate the width specified in our design, and users with smaller windows should not be penalized by the sites they visit. So, to that end, liquid layouts are designed to be entirely flexible. As the browser window expands or contracts, the page's layout will follow suite, ensuring that the content fills the display at any window size.</p>

<p>Most apologists for fixed-width techniques will say that their users' screen resolutions have been increasing over recent years, and that designing for smaller screen resolutions is no longer necessary. Their serve logs might tell them than an overwhelming majority of their users are running resolutions such as 1024 X 768 or 800 X 600, and that building a design that caters to smaller screen is less vital than it was in the early days of the Web. Designers on the other side of the debate will quickly counter with the fact that screen resolutions does not determine the size of the browser window. If a user's screen resolution is set to a specific width, the browser isn't automatically maximized to occupy all of that space. By making the assumption (and serving up a fixed-width design to match), designers can potentially exclude users who browse at smaller window sizes, forcing them to resize their pages to meet the designer's design criteria. Instead fluid layouts are agnostic when it comes to the size of the browser window. Be definition, they attempt to subvert the design to the preferences of the user, rather than the other way around.</p>

<p>Of course, liquid layouts are not without their flaws--no design technique is a silver bullet, and this is no exception. Just as it is easier to read text that has been divided into separate paragraphs, it is also easier to read text that has been set to an optimal width. This is where most fluid layouts break down. By allowing their content to reflow as the size of the browser window increase, that content can be increasing difficult to read at larger window sizes. Studies have shown that the user's ability to comprehend onscreen text suffers slightly when the length of the line being read exceeds four inches; so while a fluid layout might be ideal for small-to-medium browser window widths, legibility can suffer quite a bit when the window expands beyond that threshold.</p>
