<p><strong>HTML</strong> is a simple scripting language that instructs a Web browser how to display a Web page. A <strong>scripting language</strong> is a type of programming language that typically does not need to be <strong>parsed</strong> (interpreted by the computer) or executed as a full-blown programming language. Scripting languages run from or within other programs; they are not stand-alone applications. HTML was designed to run with different programs (such as the various Web browsers) and operating systems to exchange information through a large heterogeneous network (the Internet).</p>
<p>HTML 4.01 is likely the final version of HTML. The new recommended language for Web page development is <strong>XHTML 1.1</strong> (eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language). XHTML 1.1 is essentially HTML 4.01 that includes minor code changes, as well as stricter structural rules and syntax. The <strong>syntax</strong> of a programming language is the structure of its strings and characters. A <strong>string</strong> is a line of code that instructs the program to complete a specific task. </p>
<p>When XHTML 1.0 was standardized, it was designed to offer <strong>backward compatibility</strong>, which is the ability to support older technology and browsers, even though it was designed for newer technology and browsers. A new standard is on the horizon, however, called XHTML 2.0. This newer version does not offer support for older browsers.</p>
