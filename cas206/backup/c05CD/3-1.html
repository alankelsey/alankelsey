  <h1>Effectively Using the DIV tag with IDs</h1>
  <p><strong>Step 1 - No styling yet. </strong>We use absolute positioning to
    create a two-column layout. This format allows you to follow the widely-adopted
    convention of placing navigation in a vertical "stack" on the left side.</p>
  <p>The content area (the second column) needs to be much wider than the navigation column, as this is where the "real" information goes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - the two divs are aligned vertically.</strong> The navigation div (with its right borger in red so you can see where it is) has been absolutely positioned so its removed from the flow of the document.</p>
<p>As an absolutely positioned element, its default position is in the top left corner of its containing element: the body.</p>
<p>This allows the content div to take its place as the first element in the document flow.</p>
<p><strong>By adding a left-margin to the content div that is equal to the width of the navigation, we have our two columns.</strong></p>
<p>The next step is to do some styling and turn the page into a more professional looking layout.  We will pad the content away from the edge of the divs, change the typeface, and make the navigation look a little more inviting.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4 - cleanup complete.</strong> With all the functional issues resolved, we can turn off the styles we used to help us see what we were doing.</p>
	 
  <p>The background color is removed from the div, and the box around the h1 element is replaced with the same styles we used on the side columns, 
  with a tiny bit of top padding to center the type between the two lines.</p>
  <p>Adding <code>text-align:center</code> to the header div centers the h1 in older version of IE.</p>
</div>
<div id="rightcolumn">
	<p>This is temporary filler for the right column. We'll put something more interesting in later.</p>
