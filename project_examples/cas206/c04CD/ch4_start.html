    <p><img src="threeballoon.jpg" alt="Three Balloons" width="400" height="300" />Welcome to Far and Wee Balloons, where your dreams of floating on air can come true. We design and make hot air balloons for every use. Our balloons will give you a magical ride over country, mountains, and ocean.</p>
    <p>Come to our famous build-a-balloon design shop and you can enjoy a test flight in one of our many pre-made balloons. We organized birthday, anniversary, wedding, honeymoon and many other special occasion balloon flights for up to 100 people!</p>
    <p>Inside these pages you can examine some of the many example balloon photos as seen at balloon races,  fiestas and rallies all around the world. </p>
    <p>It's all  fun at Far and Wee Balloons. Don't wait another minute to begin your fun by coming by our Balloon Museum or our famous build-a-balloon design shop. Both are located in Timbuktu on the Avon right off US Interstate Highway 165.</p>
    <h2 class="feature">The Balloon Museum</h2>
    <p>See balloons from history and do experiments with the science of air. Stand in the same gondola that went around the world in 90 days and never made history.  Thrill to the roar of the gas burners and the silence of the wind in our balloon flight simulator with surround sound and rock-a-billy motion enhancers. </p>
    <p>Our Balloon Museum computers will let you design your own patterns and shapes for the balloon in your future. So get here now! </p>
