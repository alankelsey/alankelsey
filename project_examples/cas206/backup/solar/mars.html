The first planet beyond Earth from the sun, Mars is just over half the size of our planet. Despite long-held hopes that it might have some primitive forms of life, it appears to be a dead world, a dry, wind-blown sphere covered with iron oxide dust. It is the dust that gives Mars its blood-red appearance, which inspired the ancient Sumerians, Greeks, and Romans to associate it with their gods of war.

Mars's atmosphere, which extends some 100 miles (161 kilometers) up, is 95 percent carbon dioxide and 3 percent nitrogen, with trace amounts of oxygen, argon, carbon monoxide, and water. Predawn clouds, possibly of water vapor, form six miles (9.7 kilometers) or higher, but they usually dissipate by late morning. It is at the north pole that Mars has its most abundant water supply, in the form of a thick ice cap that grows and shrinks with the seasons.

There may also be huge reserves of water locked frozen beneath Mars's surface. One thing is almost certain: The vast channels and canyons that spread across the Martian surface were dug by flowing water at a time when the planet was, for reasons still not understood, warmer and wetter.

Temperatures vary wildly on the planet with time of day and elevation. The daytime high at the surface averages 65&deg;F (18&deg;C). Just five feet (1.5 meters) up, however, the thinner atmosphere holds almost no heat, so the temperature is only 15&deg;F (-9&deg;C). It's much like comparing the difference between temperature measurements taken at the base and summit of a large Earth mountain.

Mars's core, which is between 1,600 and 2,500 miles (2,575-4,023 kilometers) in diameter, may be liquid, like Earth’s. Unlike Earth, Mars has no planet-wide magnetic field. Recent measurements have detected small, localized magnetic fields which may be &ldquo;fossil&rdquo; remnants of a long-gone planetary field. As a result, future human explorers on Mars will not be able to use magnetic compasses, which would either spin uselessly or point at the nearest local magnetic &ldquo;pole.&rdquo;
