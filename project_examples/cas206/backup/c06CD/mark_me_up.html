<h2>Things to Remember</h2>

<div class="intro"><p>You must remember my birthday, Mar. 21<sup>st</sup>! Beyond that, try thinking about ways to give text emphasis or contrast or visual space. Keep in mind this quote from the writer Virginia DeBolt:</p>

<div class="quote">
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;CSS allows effective techniques to make large areas of text on the Web more reader friendly. Readability and appearance are affected by line length, line height, white space, font choice and other formatting. CSS also is useful for grouping material into organized content blocks that can be given semantic and visual distinction to make the text easier to read and use.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote></div>
<p>It isn't enough to remember my birthday. You should also remember what I like. I like mysteries and I like Alaska. That's why I read books like <cite>Blindfold Game</cite> by Dana Stabenow. You get both things: Alaska and mystery. The official Dana Stabenow web site is at <a href="http://www.stabenow.com">stabenow.com</a>.</p></div>

<h2>What Do You Remember?</h2>

<p>Okay, enough about me. What do you remember? Do you remember your first address? (Mine was 402 S. 7<sup>th</sup> St.) Do you remember what CO<sub>2</sub> is? Do you remember how to explain the meaning of this strange looking stuff: <div class="lottajokes">? </p>>
