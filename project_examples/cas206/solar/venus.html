Veiled in clouds, Venus is the second brightest object in the night sky. Traditionally it is thought of as Earth's sister planet, but &ldquo;evil twin&rdquo; would more closely describe it. While Venus is similar to Earth in size, mass, density and volume, it is also surrounded by thick clouds of sulfuric acid. The atmosphere is primarily carbon dioxide. And surface temperatures are similar to those in a self-cleaning oven.

It is that cloud cover&ndash;the feature that makes Venus sparkle like a jewel in our sky&ndash;that is responsible for the planet's inhospitable nature. It is a greenhouse nightmare. Heat from the sun is trapped in the atmosphere beneath the canopy to create a surface temperature of about 850&deg;F (454&deg;C), hotter even than on Mercury, which is much closer to the sun.

More than 80 percent of Venus is covered with lava flows and plains, plus other volcanic features. That's because the planet has 430 volcanoes 12 miles (19 kilometers) or more in diameter, and tens of thousands of smaller ones. Lava flows have totally resurfaced the planet over the past 300 to 500 million years. There are still some craters from relatively recent meteorite impacts, but under the planet's incredibly high atmospheric pressure&ndash;some 92 times that of Earth&ndash;ejecta does not range very far from the crater.

For centuries, the cloud cover prevented astronomers from mapping the surface of Venus. Some Earth-based radar studies revealed large formations. A handful of landers gave limited local information, but they were soon shut down by the harsh Venusian conditions. Finally, the Magellan orbiter of 1991-92 created a high-resolution radar map of the surface that showed raised continent-like land masses. Magellan mapped 84 percent of the planet in just one day&ndash;that is, one Venusian day, equal to 243 days on Earth.
